The primary objective of this project is to analyze the IMDB ratings and other attributes of video games between 2000 and 2020, including sales, category, and year. In this project, we utilized the R language and Quarto tools to organize and merge three sets of raw data, producing numerous data visualization images and tables. The main conclusion we reached is that the year, platform, and sales do not have a significant impact on the game rating, while genre and publisher have a specific effect on the game rating. Additionally, on the Wii platform, gamers are more likely to purchase first-party games.
